We use this as a starter template to quickly develop static HTML pages with :
- TailwindCSS 3.x
- Laravel Mix 6 (Webpack)
- PostCSS
- PostCSS Nested
- PostCSS Import
- Alpine JS

To get started, clone the project and install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

After that, start up Laravel Mix:

```
npm run dev
```

To watch changes:

```
npm run watch
```

Base Tailwind CSS file is under `/resources/css/app.css`  
Root HTML file is under `/public/index.html` 

To build a production bundle run:
